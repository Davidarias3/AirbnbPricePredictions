# AirbnbPricePredictions

The first goal of this project was to perform a cluster analysis that would provide interesting and actionable information for Airbnb or its customers. The second goal was to build a predictive model to estimate a listing’s price, enabling a price suggestion feature for hosts when initially listing their rentals and helping to identify the factors that most influence a listing’s price and how they do so.
